* Focus

An experiment with lenses.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A lens is a value that composes a getter and a setter function to produce a bidirectional view into a data structure. This definition is intentionally broadâ€”lenses are a very general concept, and they can be applied to almost any kind of value that encapsulates data.

** Installation

If [[https://hex.pm/docs/publish][available in Hex]], the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `focus` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:focus, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `focus` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:focus]]
    end
    ```
